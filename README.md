# README for OAF

# About
OAF is a utility to facilitate the OAuth1.0 dance with Atlassian Jira (It should work with others too).
It reads and writes key files to be consumed by other programs and utilities such as...
* Maia - https://github.com/brucephenry/maia
* Aegle - https://github.com/brucephenry/aegle

## Design
The basic design is that it reads from exteralized key files and provides an interactive commandline
session for doing the OAuth1.0 dance.

# To Do
* Make browser launching detect OS correctly.
* Enable all inputs to optionally be passed as commandline parameters
* Write results to a log file (e.g. oaf_datetime.log) 

# Known Issues
* 

# Examples

# OAF? WTF?

OAuth Facilitator... OAF... and it's OAuth1.0 so it's awkward... get it?
Sigh... never mind.
